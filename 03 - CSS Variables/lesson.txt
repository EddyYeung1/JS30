For this lesson I learned how to manipulate CSS variables using javascript. The difference between this and SASS is that SASS variables are pre compiled so they can be changed once compiled, thus knowing how to use CSS variables is useful. To declare CSS variables refer to the :root selector and declare from there. Variables are declared using this format --varName: val; and can be manipulate like this padding: var(--varName);.  Manipulating them in JS is relatively simple so refer to script.
